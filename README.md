# BubbleRemindingProject
It is a cool iOS app that allows you organise your tasks into tiny cute bubbles that float around your screen. 
You can grab them with your finger and move around. A simple reminding app that makes it fun and less dull to note your todos.

While adding a task you choose it's deadline, priority and location.
When you enter certain location you will be notified that you did and you have some tasks to do there!
You are able to choose one of three priorities - low, medium and high and change colors of the bubbles for each of them.
You are able to find a location on the map and add it to your favourite locations. 
Press on a chosen bubble and see informations related to it!
